# Specification Quality Checklist: Test Coverage Expansion

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-07-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec deliberately references domain concepts (exchange rates, filing statuses, deadlines) rather than code structures, keeping it at the business-requirements level.
- Success criteria SC-005 (9 state pairs) and SC-007 (CI time budget) provide concrete, measurable gates.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the feature description was thorough and specific, and all remaining details were resolved with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.
