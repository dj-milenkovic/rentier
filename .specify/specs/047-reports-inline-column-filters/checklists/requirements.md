# Specification Quality Checklist: Reports Inline Column Filters

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-07-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Constitution Alignment section references architecture layers by name (Desktop, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) which is appropriate for this project's established terminology and does not constitute implementation detail leakage.
- CA-002 mentions `DateOnly`, `int`, and `decimal` types as per the constitution's requirement to confirm type usage for money and dates — this is a constitution compliance check, not an implementation detail.
